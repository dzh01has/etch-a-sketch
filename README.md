# etch-a-sketch

This ToP project is supposed to exercise DOM manipulation and be challenging to create. I have to create an Etch-a-Sketch toy with the tools I have learned so far. Will revisit this README once I am finished with the project.


Edit #1: Almost done with the project!

To do: 
-improve aesthetics/visual design

-add comments in code

Will revisit once fully finished.
